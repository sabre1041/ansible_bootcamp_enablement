Welcome to the {lab_name}!

== Overview

The Ansible Bootcamp Enablement provides a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). This bootcamp covers the full spectrum of automation development, from basic concepts to advanced CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code.

Through a series of progressive labs, you'll gain practical experience with:

* **Development Environments**: Setting up and using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces for Ansible development
* **Content Development**: Creating, testing, and publishing Ansible collections
* **Automation Hub Management**: Managing content in Private Automation Hub
* **CI/CD Integration**: Building automated pipelines for collection development and deployment
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing AAP configuration through code
* **Cloud Deployments**: Deploying AAP on various platforms including Azure and OpenShift

== Prerequisites

Before starting this bootcamp, ensure you have:

* Basic understanding of Linux command line operations
* Familiarity with YAML syntax
* Knowledge of fundamental networking concepts
* Access to the Red Hat Demo Platform environment

== Lab Structure

The bootcamp is organized into sequential modules that build upon each other:

. **xref:01-introduction.adoc[Introduction]**: Environment setup and Dev Spaces configuration
. **xref:02-aap-azure.adoc[AAP on Azure]**: Managed deployment on Microsoft Azure
. **xref:03-developer-tools.adoc[Developer Tools]**: Essential tools for automation development
. **xref:04-managing-content-automation-hub.adoc[Managing Content in Automation Hub]**: Collection development and publishing
. **xref:05-ansible-tdd.adoc[Test-Driven Development for Ansible]**: Testing methodologies and practices
. **xref:06-ansible-cicd.adoc[CI/CD for Ansible Content]**: Automated pipelines and deployment
. **xref:07-configuration-as-code.adoc[Configuration as Code]**: Infrastructure and configuration management
. **xref:08-aap-openshift.adoc[AAP on OpenShift]**: Operator-based deployment on OpenShift

== Learning Outcomes

By the end of this bootcamp, you will be able to:

* Set up and configure development environments for Ansible automation
* Develop, test, and publish Ansible collections
* Implement CI/CD pipelines for automation content
* Deploy and manage AAP across different platforms
* Apply infrastructure as code principles to automation platforms
* Troubleshoot and optimize automation workflows
