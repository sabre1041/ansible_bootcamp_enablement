= Lab: Ansible Development in Dev Spaces

[abstract]
We will explore the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces environment and learn how to launch and configure development workspaces for Ansible automation development. This includes understanding the various components available in the demo environment, authenticating with git repositories, and using the Ansible Development Tools extension.

This lab is hosted on the Red Hat Demo Platform. This section walks through the various components and aspects of launching, configuring and using Dev Spaces on OpenShift as your primary development environment for Ansible.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Navigate the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces interface
* Launch and configure development workspaces
* Understand the demo environment components
* Set up authentication for git repositories
* Use basic Ansible Development Tools features

== 1. Introduction: What is included in the demo environment

. Red Hat OpenShift Platform
. Ansible Automation Platform
. Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces
. Gitea
. Lab Instructions

== Contributing to this Lab Documentation

If you see an error in this lab, fork and submit a pull request against https://github.com/sabre1041/ansible_bootcamp_enablement

== 2. Dev Spaces console

*Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces* provides consistent, reproducible development environments based on the open-source project *Eclipse Che*.

It works by using a `devfile`, a YAML file that defines the entire workspace as codeâ€”including all necessary tools, runtimes, and project source. This file is used to instantly generate a pre-configured, containerized development environment, ensuring every developer on a team has an identical setup and solving the "it works on my machine" problem.

.Launching Dev Spaces from OpenShift

. Open the `OpenShift Console` link from your lab instructions
. Check the `authentication` information in the lab instructions to login
. Click on `Operators`
. Click on `Installed Operators`
. To the far right of `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces` click the link under `Provided APIs` titled `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance Specification`
+

+
. Under `Details` click the `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces URL`
+

NOTE: These are the long steps. For a shortcut, use the 9-block icon in the upper right to launch `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces`

== 3. Dev Spaces Workspace

.Launching a specific Dev Spaces Workspace

. Login via OpenShift authentication provided in lab instructions
. Select `Allow selected permissions` to authorize access and launch the console
. Scroll down and select the workspace titled `Ansible Dev Space`
+

+
. This will take a few minutes and eventually show the VSCode interface. While it loads think about the previous page that you can't see right now. There were other workspaces available and an input box to provide your own git URL.

. Trust the extension publishers if you wish to continue
. Trust the authors of this workspace if you know us
. Wait a few minutes until the additional extension icons appear for Ansible and OpenShift on the left side.

== Ansible and OpenShift Extensions

For this lab we have have provided a `.code-workspace` configuration that listed these extensions. See https://github.com/jeffcpullen/devspaces-example/blob/main/devspaces.code-workspace

. Click on the `Ansible` extension icon to access the Ansible Development Tools extension (covered in a later lab)

== User Credentials in Workspaces

If you would like to add Personal Access tokens for Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket this can be set once and applied to all your workspaces. This is done after logging into the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces dashboard, then in the top right drop down next to your username and icon and select, "User Preferences". In the User Preferences page you will want to select "Personal Access Tokens" and add a git Personal Access Token (PAT).

== Accessing a Terminal

. Open a new terminal from the VSCode menu starting with the hamburger (3 horizontal lines) in the top left choosing `Terminal` then `New Terminal`
