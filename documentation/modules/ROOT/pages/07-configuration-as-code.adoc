= Lab: Configuration as Code

[abstract]
Learn how to manage your entire Ansible Automation Platform configuration as code using Ansible playbooks. This includes configuring organizations, teams, users, credentials, projects, inventories, job templates, and execution environments through automated, version-controlled processes.

== Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Understand the principles of infrastructure and configuration as code
* Configure AAP organizations, teams, and users programmatically
* Manage credentials, projects, and inventories through code
* Create and configure job templates via automation
* Implement execution environment management
* Deploy complete AAP configurations using CI/CD pipelines

== 1: Introduction

In this module, we will explore how to manage Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) configurations declaratively as code using Ansible playbooks and the `infra.aap_configuration` collection instead of manually configuring settings through the AAP user interface. This approach allows for automated, repeatable, and version-controlled management of AAP settings, ensuring consistency across environments.

WARNING: In prior labs, we provided many of the values that were required to simplify the experience. However, in this lab, you will be required to specify the majority of the values based on your environment. This approach will enable you to better understand how the values apply to Configuration as Code.

== 2. Lab Setup: Configuring Your Environment

First, let's build a new EE with all our required collections including the `infra.aap_configuration` collection.

=== 2.1: Local Environment Preparation

Create a new directory called `config_as_code` for the resources that will be created within this lab and change into the newly created directory.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
mkdir  /projects/devspaces-example/config_as_code
cd /projects/devspaces-example/config_as_code
----

=== 2.2: Build a new EE

Create a new `execution-environment.yml` file within the `config_as_code` directory with the following content:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="execution-environment.yml"]
----
---

    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_PUBLISHED_URL='{aap_controller_web_url}/pulp_ansible/galaxy/published/'
    - ENV ANSIBLE_GALAXY_SERVER_PUBLISHED_TOKEN=$TOKEN
----

=== 2.3: Build and Publish the Execution Environment

Build and push a new execution environment (EE) to your Private Automation Hub (PAH) registry that will enable the use of Config as Code.

NOTE: Ensure that the `PAH_API_TOKEN` environment variable is set within your terminal session so that the build process can retrieve the required set of dependencies.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
# Log in to your PAH container registry
podman login aap-aap.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}

# Build the EE. It will pull the base from PAH, then add our content.
ansible-builder build --tag config_as_code_ee:1.0 --build-arg TOKEN=$PAH_API_TOKEN

# Tag and push the image to your PAH registry
podman tag localhost/config_as_code_ee:1.0 aap-aap.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/config_as_code_ee:1.0
podman push aap-aap.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/config_as_code_ee:1.0
----

=== 2.4: Creating Variable Files

Config as Code leverages Ansible variables files containing properties that will be used to drive the configuration of AAP. These variables include hosts, usernames, and other items that are reused in each role contained within the Config as Code collection.

Create a new directory `config/dev` containing variables for a _dev_ AAP instance

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
mkdir -p config/dev
----

Create the file `config/dev/auth.yml` with the following content. 

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="config/dev/auth.yml"]
----
aap_hostname: <AAP_HOST>
aap_username: "{{ student_account }}"
aap_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
aap_validate_certs: false
aap_request_timeout: 60

ee_pull_collections_from_hub: true
aap_service_account_username: aap_service_account

ee_registry_username: "{{ aap_username }} "
ee_registry_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
ee_registry_dest: "{{ aap_hostname }}/config"

ee_base_registry: "{{ aap_hostname }}"
ee_base_registry_username: "{{ aap_username }}"
ee_base_registry_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
ee_validate_certs: false
----

IMPORTANT: Update the value of `<AAP_HOST>` to match the location of your AAP instance (`aap-aap.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}`).

=== 2.5: Define Secrets with Ansible Vault

Certain configurations of AAP contain sensitive information such as passwords and tokens. To securely manage these secrets, we will use Ansible Vault to encrypt them.

Create a file `config/dev/vault.yml` to store sensitive information.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="config/dev/vault.yml"]
----
---
aap_password: ### Insert AAP admin password here
aap_service_account_password: admin123!
console_token: ### Insert Red Hat Automation Hub console token here
hub_token: ### Insert Private Automation Hub (PAH) token here
gitea_pass: ### Insert Gitea password here
student_account: admin
vault_pass: cascLB2193
...
----

NOTE: You will need to replace the placeholder values (### Insert ... here) with the actual values. 

NOTE: For good configuration as code we recommend retrieving passwords from secure systems secret management systems (such as Hashicorp Vault).

Create a `.password` file and put a password in it. This is the password vault uses to encrypt secrets. You can use the value provided, or choose a different value entirely.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title=".password"]
----
cascLB2193
----

IMPORTANT: **We do not recommend using .password files outside of lab environment** This process is just to simplify/speed up the lab.

The `ansible.cfg` configuration file points to the `.password` file which instructs Ansible Vault to use this file encrypting and decrypting sensitive values. This has been preopulated, but please review the `ansible.cfg`` file to see how this lab is connected to hub and uses the password file.

Create a `ansible.cfg` file with the following content:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="ansible.cfg"]
----
[defaults]
vault_password_file=.password
----

Encrypt the contents of the `config/dev/vault.yml` file using the password in the .password file

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
ansible-vault encrypt config/dev/vault.yml
----

Additional documentation related to these tools can be found in the following resources below:

* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html[Ansible vaults,window=_blank]
* https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/faq/#how-can-i-use-a-vault-password-with-ansible-navigator[Vault with navigator,window=_blank]

=== 2.5: Create organizations

Config as Code leverages a standard set of variables that drives the configuration of different AAP resources. The next few sections will define the variables related to configure these reources.

Create a `config/all/organizations.yml` file to define the organizations to be created on AAP.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="config/all/organizations.yml"]
----
---
aap_organizations_all:
  - name: config_as_code
...
----

Documentation related to this component can be found below:

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.aap_configuration/tree/devel/roles/gateway_organizations[Organizations role,window=_blank]

=== 2.6: Create a Team

Create a `config/all/teams.yml` file to define the teams to be created on AAP.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="config/all/teams.yml"]
----
---
aap_teams_all:
  - name: config as code team
    description: config as code team
    organization: config_as_code
...
----

Documentation related to this component can be found below:

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.aap_configuration/tree/devel/roles/gateway_teams[Teams role,window=_blank]

=== 2.7: Create a local service account user

Create a `config/all/users.yml` file to define the users to be created on AAP.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="config/all/users.yml"]
----
---
aap_user_accounts_all:
  - username: "{{ aap_service_account_username }}"
    password: "{{ aap_service_account_password }}"
    is_superuser: true
    state: "present"
...
----

=== 2.8: Create hosts inventory file

Create a `hosts` inventory file that defines how the execution of Config as Code will be run:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="hosts"]
----
[dev]
localhost
----

Documentation related to this component can be found below:

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.aap_configuration/tree/devel/roles/gateway_users[Users role,window=_blank]

=== 2.9: Create Collection Repositories and Remotes

Create a `config/all/hub_repositories.yml` file to create the list of community repositories and their remote counterpart.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="config/all/hub_repositories.yml"]
----
---
hub_collection_remotes_all:
  - name: rh-certified

=== 2.10: Create a playbook to apply the configuration

The next step is to create a playbook that can be used to execute Config as Code.

Create a directory called `playbooks` and within the newly created directory, create an `aap_config.yml` playbook. This playbook will execute the `aap_configuration` dispatch role, applying the provided configurations in the necessary order to configure AAP.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="playbooks/aap_config.yml"]
----
---
- name: Playbook to configure ansible controller
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    dispatch_include_wildcard_vars: true
  tasks:
    - name: Include common vars
      ansible.builtin.include_vars:
        dir: ../config/all
        extensions:
          - 'yml'

    - name: Include env vars
      ansible.builtin.include_vars:
        dir: "../config/{{ env }}"
        extensions:
          - 'yml'

    - name: Call dispatch role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:

=== 2.11: Check your paths

After creating the files and directories as described in the prior sections, the following directory should be present, Here's the desired layout for your folders from the root of the repository. Please examine the file organization to confirm that each file resides in its correct location within this structure.

[source,bash]
----
.
├── ansible.cfg
├── config
│   ├── all
│   │   ├── hub_repositories.yml
│   │   ├── organizations.yml
│   │   ├── teams.yml
│   │   └── users.yml
│   └── dev
│       ├── auth.yml
│       └── vault.yml
├── hosts
└── playbooks
    └── aap_config.yml

4 directories, 8 files
----

== 3: Publish to Gitea

With the proper configurations in place, we need to save our work to our Gitea instance.

=== 3.1: Create Gitea Repository

Use the following steps to create a new repository on your Gitea instance.

. Navigate to your link:{gitea_console_url}[Gitea instance,window=_blank] and click the **Sign In** button on the upper right hand corner
. Enter the username and password using the credentials provided from the xref:environment-details.adoc[Environment Details,window=_blank] page and click the **Sign In** button
. In the top left corner, click on the **+** symbol and select **New Repository**.
. On the New Repository page, enter 'ansible_bootcamp_config_as_code' in the Repository Name field.
. Leave everything else as default and click on the button at the bottom, **Create Repository**.

=== 3.2: Create `.gitignore` file

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your repository with the following content to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being tracked by Git.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title=".gitignore"]
----
context/
.password
ansible.cfg
.ansible/
.vscode/

----

=== 3.3: Push code to repository

After an empty repository is created on your Gitea, we need to push the collection to the repository.

In the section _Clone this repository_, click the **Copy URL** icon on the far right to copy Gitea repository URL for the _HTTPS_ protocol option.

Execute the following commands in the root directory of `config_as_code` directory.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
git init
git checkout -b main
git add --all
git commit -m "Uploading config on initial commit"
git remote add origin {gitea_console_url}/{gitea_user}/ansible_bootcamp_config_as_code.git
git push -u origin main
----

== 4: Execute your first Configuration as Code Playbook

=== 4.1: Run the Playbook

The next step is to run the playbook that executes Config as Code. This process kicks off the initial setup for everything we've just created for the Ansible Automation Platform.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
ansible-navigator run --pp=missing --eei=aap-aap.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/config_as_code_ee:1.0 -m stdout playbooks/aap_config.yml -e env=dev
----

While the playbook is running, you can navigate to Automation Hub and review the progress in the **Task Management** page within to see the repository syncing process

image::07-configuration-as-code/hub_task.png[Hub task,125%,125%,link=self, window=blank]

=== 4.2: Validate the configuration was applied

Now that Config as Code was applied to AAP, navigate to your AAP instance and verify that the configuration was applied correctly.

In particular, confirm that the following objects have been correctly created within your AAP instance and aligns to the definitions specified previously in the variable files.

. Org
. Repository
. User
. Team

== 5: Additional Configuration as Code Components

In this section, you will only be given a summary of the objects you
need to create along with screenshots of a configured controller instance that has been configured with the completed code. You will also be provided the variables sections from the README's for each of the required roles to help you complete this task.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to follow the steps within each section to ensure all of the desired objects are created.

=== 5.1: Configure settings

Create a `config/all/settings.yml` file with the following content.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="config/all/settings.yml"]
----
---
controller_settings_all:

=== 5.2: Configure Execution Environments

Create a file `config/all/execution_environments.yml` to define Execution Environment and the following required information under the `controller_execution_environments_all` property:

. `name` should be called `config_as_code`
. `image` should be set to the path of the image you created earlier in the lab: `{{ aap_hostname }}/config_as_code_ee:1.0` 
. `pull` should be set to `always`
. `credential` should be set to `cr_ah`.

=== 5.3: Create credential types

Create a `config/all/credential_types.yml` file to define a set of Custom Credential types as a list under the `controller_credential_types` property that has 5 variables per item defined below:

. `name` defines the value that the credential type will be called
. `description` defines the description of the credential type
. `kind` is the type of credential type being added. Note that only cloud
and net can be used for creating credential types.
* `inputs` are defined in either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer to the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credential_types.html[Ansible controller documentation,window=_blank] for example syntax. These will be the
fields in the AAP user interface that prompt the user for input.
* `injectors` are defined in either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer
to the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credential_types.html[Ansible controller documentation,window=_blank] for example syntax. These are associated with variables that will then be useable within a job.

The role included within Config as Code will iterate through this list and for each item and create a custom credential type within Automation Controller.

=== 5.10: Update the Playbook

As part of the Config as Code execution and based on the AAP components that we have defined ths far, we need a token from Automation Hub to be configured within Automation Controller so that it can interact with Private Automation Hub. The playbook will first obtain an Automation Hub token using the `ansible.hub.ah_token` and set a variable that has been defined in our Config as Code configurations earlier.

Create a `playbooks/aap_config.yml` file that will call the `dispatch` role of the `infra.aap_configuration` collection to apply all provided configurations in the order that AAP expects them to be created.

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes",title="Updated playbooks/aap_config.yml"]

=== 5.11: Run the playbook

Execute the `playbooks/aap_config` playbook created in the prior section to set up AAP using the Configuration as Code resources created within this section.

[source,console,role=execute,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
ansible-navigator run -m stdout playbooks/aap_config.yml -e env=dev
----

If issues occur during the execution, the following are several steps that you can take to resolve the challenges:
. Review the error message provided in the output of the playbook execution to identify the specific issue.
. Refer to the configuration that was being applied including the Config as Code role. Review the documentation including the supported properties for that role.
. If the output was hidden, look for "Secure logging variables" on the https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.aap_configuration/blob/devel/roles/controller_credentials[controller_credentials role documentation,window=_blank].

TIP: If an errors occurs during the execution with a message similar to  "Failed to get token: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized" while other tasks pass, please rerun the playbook. this is a known issue within the collection.

=== 5.12: Review the Results

Once the playbook has completed successfully, navigate to link:{aap_controller_web_url}[AAP,window=_blank] to review the configurations that have been applied.

== Conclusion

Within this lab, you have successfully implemented Configuration as Code using Validated Content provided for Ansible Automation Platform. In particular, you have completed the following tasks:

. Built custom Execution Environments with all required collections for AAP configuration
. Created structured variable files and encrypted secrets using Ansible Vault
. Configured organizations, teams, users, and service accounts
. Set up collection repositories, remotes, and automation credentials
. Deployed and configured Ansible projects, inventories, job templates, and workflows
. Performed all of the above configurations using the `infra.aap_configuration` collection

This approach enables you to manage your entire AAP infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency, version control, and repeatability across environments. The skills learned here form the foundation for managing complex enterprise automation platforms.
