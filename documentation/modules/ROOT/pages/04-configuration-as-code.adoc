= Configuration as Code

== Building out the basics for config as code

[#setup]
== 1. Lab Setup: Configuring Your Environment

First, let's build a new EE with all our required collections.

=== Step 1.1: Build new EE

----

NOTE: Replace the following values `pah.example.com` With the URL of your Private Automation Hub. Also update `YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE` With the personal API token you just copied from PAH.

=== Task 2: Build and Publish the Execution Environment

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Log in to your PAH container registry
podman login pah.example.com

# Build the EE. It will pull the base from PAH, then add our content.
ansible-builder build --tag config_as_code_ee:1.0 --build-arg TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE

# Tag and push the image to your PAH registry
podman tag localhost/config_as_code_ee:1.0 pah.example.com/config_as_code_ee:1.0
podman push pah.example.com/config_as_code_ee:1.0
----

[#variable_files]
=== Task 3 - Creating Variable Files

**In the next few steps pay attention to the folder paths and make sure to put the files in the correct folders you can either use vscode editor or the ssh terminal to do the below changes** 

- Set the `variables` to be used in the collections for use. These include hosts, usernames, and other variables that are reused in each role.

- The variables are defined in the file `config/dev/auth.yml`. 

[source,yaml,role=execute,title="config/dev/auth.yml"]
----
aap_hostname: <GATEWAY URL>
aap_username: "{{ student_account }}"
aap_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
aap_validate_certs: false
aap_request_timeout: 60

ee_pull_collections_from_hub: true
aap_service_account_username: aap_service_account

ee_registry_username: "{{ aap_username }} "
ee_registry_password: "{{ aap_password }}"

ee_base_registry: "{{ aap_hostname }}"
ee_base_registry_username: "{{ aap_username }}"

[#vault]
=== Task 4 - Create our Vault

- The secrets are defined in the file `config/dev/vault.yml`. 
- Your username should be: {ssh_username}
- Your password should be: {ssh_password}
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,title="config/dev/vault.yml"]
----
---
aap_password: ### Insert Password here
aap_service_account_password: ### Insert Password here
student_account: ### Insert Username here
vault_pass: cascLB2193
...
----
+
TIP: The easiest way to do this is have all passwords be the provided password.
+
NOTE: For good configuration as code we recommend retrieving passwords from secure systems secret management systems (such as Hashicorp Vault).

- Create a `.password` file and put a password in it. This is the password vault uses to encrypt secrets.
+
[source,bash,role=execute,title=".password"]
----
cascLB2193
----
+
IMPORTANT: **We do not recommend using .password files outside of lab environment** This process is just to simplify/speed up the lab.

- The `ansible.cfg` file points to the `.password` file. This has been preopulated, but please review the ansible.cfg file to see how this lab is connected to hub and uses the password file.
+
[source,bash,role=execute,title="ansible.config"]
----
[defaults]
vault_password_file=.password
----

Encrypt vault with the password in the .password file

[#playbook_create]
=== Task 9 - Create a playbook to apply the configuration

- The next step is to create the `playbooks/aap_config.yml` playbook. This playbook will execute the `aap_configuration` dispatch role, applying the provided configurations in the necessary order.
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
---
- name: Playbook to configure ansible controller post installation

[#playbook_run]
=== Task 11 - Put the playbook into action

- The next step is to run this playbook, this kicks off the initial setup for everything we've just created for the Ansible Automation Platform.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-navigator run --stout playbooks/aap_config.yml

- While the playbook is running you can go to the Automation Hub tab and peak at the Task Management to see the repository syncing process

image::04-configuration-as-code/hub_task.png[Hub task,125%,125%,link=self, window=blank]

[#results]
=== Task 12 - Validate configuration was applied
- Navigate to the AAP console and login with the provided passwords (You will find the link to the console on the start page of this lab)

Check that the following objects have been correctly created on AAP and are aligned with the instructions above

. Org
. Repository
. User
. Team

== Configuring the Automation controller

In this section, you will only be given a summary of the objects you
need to create along with some screenshots of a controller that is
configured with the completed code. You will also be provided the
variables sections from the readme’s for each of the required roles to
help you complete this task.

=== Task 1 - Configure settings

- Create a file `config/all/settings.yml` with the below content.
+ 
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
---
controller_settings_all:
  settings:
    GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS: true
...
----

- Further documentation are provided below for those who are interested to learn more:

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.aap_configuration/blob/devel/roles/controller_settings[Settings role,window=_blank]

=== Task 2 - Configure Execution Environments

- Create a file `config/all/execution_environments.yml` and add the required information to the list `controller_execution_environments`
to include a new EE (that we will show how to create with code in the next module) called `config_as_code` with image path `{{ aap_hostname }}/config_as_code` that is pull `always` and uses the credential `cr_ah`.
+

    credential: cr_ah

  - name: "minimal"
    image: "{{ aap_hostname }}/ee-minimal-rhel8"
    pull: always
    credential: cr_ah

...

----
NOTE: While you have not created this EE yet it, we have already added a version to hub so this won't fail.

- Further documentation for those who are interested to learn more see:
+
* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.aap_configuration/blob/devel/roles/controller_execution_environments[Execution Environments role,window=_blank]

=== Task 3 - Create credential types

- Create a file `config/all/credential_types.yml` where we will create a list called `controller_credential_types` that has 5 variables per item defined below:

* `name` this is required and will be what the credential type will be
called
* `description` this is the description of the credential type
* `kind` The type of credential type being added. Note that only cloud
and net can be used for creating credential types.
* `inputs` Enter inputs using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer to the
Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These will be the
fields in the GUI that prompt the user for input.
* `injectors` Enter injectors using either JSON or YAML syntax. Refer
to the Ansible controller documentation for example syntax. These are
the variables that will then be useable in a job.
+
The role will iterate through this list and for each item in this list it will create custom credential types for using it in the controller.

=== Task 10 - Update the Playbook
==== Update the playbook to get the hub token for the configuration

- We need to create a token from Automation Hub so that we can provide it to the Platform for the collection syncing to take place.
+
The next step is to create a playbook/file `playbooks/aap_config.yml` that will call the aap_configuration dispatch role which will apply all provided configurations in the order that they need to be created.

...
----

=== Task 11 - Run the playbook

- Run `/home/lab-user/casc_lab/playbooks/aap_config` playbook.
+
[source,console]
----
ansible-playbook playbooks/aap_config.yml -i inventory.yml -l execution
----

- If you run into problems, look back at the section that failed, and check the documentation for that role that was linked. If the output was hidden, look for 'Secure logging variables' on the https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.aap_configuration/blob/devel/roles/controller_credentials[controller_credentials role documentation].

TIP: If you run into an error that says "Failed to get token: HTTP Error 401: Unauthorized" while other tasks pass, please rerun the playbook, this is a known issue.

=== Task 12 - See the Results

- After the playbook is complete you should be able to navigate to the controller and see all the changes.
