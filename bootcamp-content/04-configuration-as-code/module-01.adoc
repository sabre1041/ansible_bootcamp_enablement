= Building out the basics for config as code

[#setup]
== Task 1 - Setting up the project

- In this lab, you will be creating configuration files in order to set a state on the Ansible Automation Platform.
This requires several prerequisites.

- Open up the terminal in the window on the right by going to the menu, use the Terminal > New Terminal

- In the terminal, install the collections and containers.podman using `ansible-galaxy` command. Make sure the versions are correct and you are running command from the path `/home/lab-user/casc_lab/`.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd /home/lab-user/casc_lab/
----
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install infra.ee_utilities:4.0.0 infra.aap_configuration:3.1.0 containers.podman:1.16.3 community.general:10.4.0 ansible.hub:1.0.0 ansible.platform:2.5.20250213 ansible.controller:4.6.8

[#variable_files]
== Task 2 - Creating Variable Files

**In the next few steps pay attention to the folder paths and make sure to put the files in the correct folders you can either use vscode editor or the ssh terminal to do the below changes** 

- Set the `variables` to be used in the collections for use. These include hosts, usernames, and other variables that are reused in each role.

- The variables are defined in the file `group_vars/all/auth.yml`. 
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
group_vars/all/auth.yml

With the following content:

[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
aap_username: "{{ student_account }}"
aap_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
aap_validate_certs: false
aap_request_timeout: 60

ee_pull_collections_from_hub: false
aap_service_account_username: aap_service_account

ee_registry_username: "{{ aap_username }} "
ee_registry_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
ee_registry_dest: "{{ aap_hostname }}/config"

ee_base_registry: "{{ aap_hostname }}"
ee_base_registry_username: "{{ aap_username }}"
ee_base_registry_password: "{{ aap_password }}"
ee_validate_certs: false
----

WARNING: Do not replace the content that is already in this file but append/paste below it.

[#inventory]
== Task 3 - Creating our inventory file

- Create your inventory file `inventory.yml`, copy the content below to the file.
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
---
all:
  children:
    automationcontroller:
      hosts:
        control:
          ansible_host: "{{ aap_hostname | regex_replace('^https://', '')  }}"
    execution:
      hosts:
        localhost:
          ansible_connection: local
...
----
+
WARNING: These are hostnames and should not have 'https://', otherwise things will fail

[#vault]
== Task 4 - Create our Vault

- A `vault.yml` has been prepoulated, please review this as it provides a source for most of the passwords and secrets used in the lab.
- Your username should be: {ssh_username}
- Your password should be: {ssh_password}
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
---
aap_password: ### Insert Password here
aap_service_account_password: ### Insert Password here
student_account: ### Insert Username here
vault_pass: cascLB2193
...
----
+
TIP: The easiest way to do this is have all passwords be the provided password.
+
NOTE: For good configuration as code we recommend retrieving passwords from secure systems secret management systems (such as Hashicorp Vault).

- Create a `.password` file and put a password in it. This is the password vault uses to encrypt secrets.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF > .password
cascLB2193
EOF
----
+
IMPORTANT: **We do not recommend using .password files outside of lab environment** This process is just to simplify/speed up the lab.

- The `ansible.cfg` file points to the `.password` file. This has been preopulated, but please review the ansible.cfg file to see how this lab is connected to hub and uses the password file.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
[defaults]
vault_password_file=.password
----
+
Encrypt vault with the password in the .password file
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml
